## EXPERIENCE

**Bloomberg L.P.**, New York, NY  
*Software Engineering Intern* — May–Aug 2025  
- Engineered a distributed C++ rate-limiting library featuring Redis and a sharded DB to enforce tiered quotas on 10K+ daily requests across Multi-Asset Risk System (MARS) workflows, serving 3 internal teams.  
- Integrated a configurable burst control proxy to throttle per-instance requests across 20+ production clusters.  
- Featured C++ macros for real-time cost monitoring and alerting via Humio and Grafana, surfacing 9k metrics daily.  
- Achieved 80% unit-test coverage and built a multithreaded Python stress tester to validate peak-time reliability.  

**ViaSat**, Worcester, MA  
*Computer Networks Research, WPI* — Nov 2023–May 2024  
- Evaluated a custom congestion control algorithm for high-latency satellite links, achieving 20% higher TCP throughput than Hystart by preemptively exiting the slow-start phase to avoid packet loss.  
- Developed Python scripts to automate benchmarking and data capture (PCAP, logs) across 140 connections at 7 test sites via iperf3 and SSH into the Linux-based satellite systems.  
- Analyzed time-series network data with Pandas to quantify performance deltas and guide further algorithm tuning.  

**Mass General Brigham**, Boston, MA  
*Software Engineering Collaboration, WPI* — Mar–May 2024  
- Led backend pathfinding systems for a hospital navigation app (React, Express, PostgreSQL) deployed on AWS.  
- Integrated authentication, service modules, analytics and map editing features as part of a 10-person team.  
- Led a 5-engineer sub-team as the Algorithm SWE Lead, conducting daily scrums, creating user stories, gathering 30+ requirements, and designing 4 UML models for core pathfinding features.  

**Worcester Polytechnic Institute**, Worcester, MA  
*Numerical Methods Research* — Jun–Aug 2023  
- Researched real-time heat transfer solvers for PDEs using MATLAB, focusing on room cooling efficiency.  
- Implemented the heat equation as a recursive matrix system over vertex meshes using the FEM and FD methods.  
- Identified the top 3 optimal room layouts for cooling efficiency via statistical analysis using the L² and L∞ norms.  

**Worcester Polytechnic Institute**, Worcester, MA  
*Teaching Assistant* — Aug 2023–Present  
- Led labs, coached lectures, graded exams, and provided 1:1s across 9 CS courses including OS, SWE, and Networks.

## PROJECTS

**Deep Q-Learning Network** — Sep–Dec 2024  
- Implemented and trained a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) using PyTorch to master the Atari game Breakout.  
- Achieved an average reward of 220 points over 100 episodes using “Rainbow” optimizations, including prioritized experience replay, double Q-learning, dueling architecture, multi-step learning, and noisy networks.  

**Moodle Well-being App** — Mar–May 2025  
- Developed an Android mental health journaling app using Jetpack Compose, SQLite, and MVVM architecture.  
- Integrated Gemini for conversational journaling, sentiment analysis, mood trend tracking, and motivational insights.  
- Utilized historical chats, photos, and mood data with prompt engineering to create personalized monthly summaries.  


**Volunteer, Red Cross, Almeria, Spain (Summer 2020)**  
- Tutored 15 immigrant children in Spanish and math.

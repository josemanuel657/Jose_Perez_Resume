## PROJECTS

### Software Engineering Collaboration with Brigham & Women’s Hospital, WPI (March 2024 – May 2024)
- Engineered a full-stack WebApp prototype for Mass General Brigham, as part of a 10-person team, following Agile methodologies, daily scrum, and software design patterns throughout the software development lifecycle.
- Designed and deployed the application using React.js, TypeScript, Material UI, Express.js, and Prisma ORM on AWS EC2 with Docker and AWS RDS for cloud storage.
- Integrated hospital pathfinding and editing features, along with 4 service request modules, using authentication and analytics, showcasing potential features and UI designs to the hospital software development team.
- Directed a team of 5 engineers as the algorithm Assistant Lead Software Engineer, collecting 30+ requirements through surveys, interviews, and brainstorming. Created user stories, scenarios, and storyboards and 4 UML diagrams for the pathfinding component of the application, including use-case, class, and activity models.

### Computer Networks Study Collaboration with VIASAT, WPI (November 2023 – May 2024)
- Collaborated with network engineers to test a TCP Congestion Control algorithm for high-latency satellite connections, boosting throughput by up to 20% over Hystart by exiting the slow-start phase before packet loss.
- Automated data collection via Python scripts, capturing PCAP and log files from 140 satellite connections across 7 campus sites, using iperf3 and SSH to compare Linux Hystart performance with the new algorithm.
- Analyzed network data with Pandas and generated reports to demonstrate improvements in overall throughput.

### Numerical Methods Research, EREE Program, WPI (June 2023 – August 2023)
- Conducted research on real-time heat diffusion using the Finite Element (FEM) and Finite Differences (FD) methods across 30 room configurations, applying numerical analysis and computational modeling techniques.
- Implemented the heat partial differential equation in MATLAB as a recursive matrix equation on a vertex mesh and identified the 3 most optimal configurations through statistical assessment using L2 and L∞ norms.

### Machine Learning Model Fine-Tuning, WPI (January 2024 – February 2024)
- Fine-tuned a ML model using OpenAI API and Scikit-Learn, enhancing QA dataset accuracy by 15%.
- Evaluated performance and optimized the model with data preprocessing techniques, reducing hallucinations.
